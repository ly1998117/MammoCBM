## Requirements for the Output:

	1.	Use a table format for clarity, with categories and subcategories organized hierarchically.
	2.	Extract and display the data from the JSON input accurately.
	3.	Ensure the table uses clear and concise medical language appropriate for radiology reports.
	4.  If other information provided, please represent before the tabular format.
